# Introduction

## What is a booru?
A booru is a imageboard similar to Danbooru in it's tagging style.

## What is a tag?

A tag is a short word or series of word to precisely identify features of images, for example "long hair" "long shirt", some boorus that are more character-centric ignore specific descriptions and instead use character and series names only for example "Mario" "Super Mario Bros."

## What is the objective of the booru standard?
Currently there are many boorus, some use slightly different tagging systems than the others, for example Danbooru-derived boorus use underscore-based tags:

> hat plumber blue_eyes

Booru-on-rails uses comma based tags:

> hat, plumber, blue eyes

Both are sort of intuitive, but the problem comes when boorus introduce some specific things, for example, adding the series name to differentiate characters:

> Mario(Super_Mario_bros.)

or simply using the character's name with another tag representing the series.

>Mario Super_Mario_bros

You can see how this becomes really unintuitive when using many booru, but it's still acceptable because you can quickly learn this, but it gets even worse when you get to metadata searches, for example trying to sort by score:

> order:score

> sort:score

The standard has been created in an effort to unify searching in booru sites, this way users can go from one booru to another, this standard is not restrictive, the owners of the sites can add new features on top of the standard.
